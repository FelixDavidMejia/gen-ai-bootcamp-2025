# Backend API Implementation *
I wrote the technical specifications in file <file:project_directives.md> for the same backend using flask. I worked along the assistant to identify and then elaborated a plan to implement the missing endpoints, which we did. Those missing endpoints that we built, are documented in file <file: missing_endpoints_documentation.md>. Then I asked the assistant to write a test suite, which is deployed in the folder <folder:tests>. After a few rounds of error correction, we got to successfully run all 4 tests created for each endpoint and a complete study flow.

I used windsurf, which I selected for its lower cost compared to cursor (just in case the trial is not enough). What we did was identify the missing endpoints, analyze both backend and frontend code to find the missing elements, and then we implemented from there. Then built the test suite and ran the tests. I have never programmed in python before, my programming skills are kind of rusty, but I feel happy because after putting hands on, everything started to flow (I was frozen before starting).

In the folder <folder:work-logs> I saved the complete chat interaction <file:prompts-used.md> and the terminal output of all the environment setup and testing in file <file:terminal-stdio.txt> and <file:terminal-stdio.html>.

# Considerations / Exceptions / Accommodations
Well, I have lost a lot of time, because I have been sick the last week and a half. My sinus infection got out of control and I have been feeling bad. I am not recovered yet, but I feel better and the thoughts of quitting the bootcamp are now fading. I will be trying harder. When I put hands on this I am surprised that I could complete at least the first part of the homework of creating the missing APIs. Now I am late for Week 2, I have a lot of videos from week 1 pending, but I will be moving FWD to Week 2, so I can try to catch up. I don't want any special considerations, I only want to be able to go FWD the best as I can, and learn the most I can. Thanks again Andrew!
