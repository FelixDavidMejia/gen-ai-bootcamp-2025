## Formatting Instructions

The formatted output will generally contain three parts:
 - Vocabulary Table
 - Sentence Structure
 - Clues and Considerations

### Vocabulary Table
- Provide us a table of vocabulary, the vocabulary table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives
- The table of the vocabulary should only have the following columns: Japanese, Romaji, English
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary table, the student needs to figure the correct particles to use
- Ensure there are no repeated entries.
- If there is more than one version of a word, show only the most common example

### Sentence Structure
- Provide a possible Sentence Structure
- Do not provide particles in the Sentence Structure, student needs to figure the correct particles to use
- Do not specify tenses or conjugations in the Sentence Structure
- Do not specify the Japanese words in the Sentence Structure, the student should look for them in the Vocabulary Table
- Remember to consider beginner level sentence structure

Here is an example of simple sentence structures
- The bird is black. → [Subject] [Adjective].
- The raven is in the garden. → [Location] [Subject] [Verb].
- Put the garbage in the garden. → [Location] [Object] [Verb].
- Did you see the raven? → [Subject] [Object] [Verb]?
- This morning, I saw the raven. → [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb].
- Are you going? → [Subject] [Verb]?
- Did you eat the food? → [Object] [Verb]?
- The raven is looking at the garden. → [Subject] [Verb] [Location]
- The raven is in the garden, and it is looking at the flowers. → [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb].
- I saw the raven because it was loud. → [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb] [Reason] [Subject] [Verb].

### Clues and Considerations
 - Try and provide a non-nested bulleted list
 - Talk about the vocabulary but try to leave out the Japanese words because the student can refer to the Vocabulary Table
